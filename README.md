# moviecatalog
This is a simple movie catalog. You can print the whole movie list, filter by genre, add and delete movies.

This is my very first project. 

I've been working on class, herency and different files to import from my own folder. Creating methods and functions.

It's a simple movie catalog where you can print the whole list, print by genre, add and delete movies. Every movie is 
a instance of a class called Movies (Pel√≠culas in Spanish) where you define the name, length, director, year and genre.

It would be easy to modify the code to add series as a subclass from movies where you can add the number of seasons and
the number of episodes for seasons.

Hope you enjoy as much as I did in my first project.
